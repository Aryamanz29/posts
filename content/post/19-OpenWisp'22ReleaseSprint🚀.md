From last one week, Me and other fellow contributors were participating in [OpenWisp'22](https://openwisp.org/) release sprint, Today It finally came to an end. This was a very new experience for me because I got the opportunity to learn about how actually maintainers of big open-source project reviews contributors PR's and what they're actually wanted from contributors to do before they request review from maintainers. I'll mention some valuable points which I've noted during this sprint, and they are very useful for new contributors.

- **Read documentation** : Before diving into an issue section, I would always suggest everyone to read documentation first, In [OpenWisp](https://openwisp.org/) you found every project is well documented. Not only you're going to understand how the project is working (technical aspect), but you'll also get an idea about motivation of the project i.e. why it started, what real world problem it tries to solve, What it's going to achieve in future etc.

- **Code is not always right** : You always think that if I solve this issue or that issue, my PR's easily get merged into projects, but this is not a good practice when it comes to contributing to big projects. As Federico said, _We are humans we can easily read about changes, but its hard to read actual code, while were maintaining large projects._ This means, let say If today I created a PR for feature Y, and I simply just write code without good commit message (not explain properly about my changes) then it may not create concern today but in future this small thing will create some serious issue, and we can't figure out why we're facing this issue.

- **Test driven development** :  Google says, _Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases._ So whenever you're solving bugs don't forgot to write tests for that and remember if you remove your patch from code that test case must fail to justify your change & the test case must be specific to your patch.

- **Double Check Double Check** : Do you remember your high school exams? You also re-check everything before submission, Same practice we are applying here while submitting PR's for maintainers & do always remember to double-check your work and try to run for different cases, That's not only saves your time but also maintainers as well.

- **Be patient** : Always remember, open-source contribution is a game of checking your level of patience. Do your work and make sure you follow above mention steps then leave your PR for maintainers review (You may also ping them on their IRC channel), They'll are also wanted to check your work and suggest you changes if required, but you need to be patient for that, You may start working on other issue during that time, don't sit idle if you want to contribute and learn new things ðŸ˜„
