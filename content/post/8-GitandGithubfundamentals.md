# Practice Git and Github fundamentals

Imagine you are working on a project and you add some code to it that breaks the project and you want to roll back to that point that before the change was made.
Git facilitates that by acting as a Version Control System.

## Issues faced by early developers before git

* Developers had to submit their codes to the  without having copies of their own
* Any changes made to the source code were unknown to the other developers
* There was no communication between any of the developers

## How git changed the scenario

* Every developer has an entire copy of the code on their 
* Any changes made to the source code can be tracked by others
* There is regular communication between the developers

## What is git?
 
Git is a  system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development:

* Git is used to  in the source code
* The distributed version control tool is used for source code management
* It allows multiple developers to work together
* It supports non-linear development through its thousands of 

## About Version Control:
#### What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though, in reality, you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
